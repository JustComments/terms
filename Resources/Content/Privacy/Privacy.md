title: Privacy Policy
----

## In General

We try our best to minimise the data we collect. We do not share your data with third parties unless you give explicit permission for us to do so. Any future changes to this Privacy Policy will be publicly announced.

## Emails

We will occasionally use your name and/or email address to send you newsletters or transactional emails. We don’t use any third-party emailing service to reduce data sharing. You can opt-out of these types of emails at any time in your account settings or the link in each email. 

## Analytics

We do not use any 3rd party tracking software. The only data we collect are the default log files generated by our web server.

## Cookies

We use (session) cookies to allow our users to sign in and to optionally “remember” the login data.

## Third-Party Platform Integrations

We provide several platform integrations to show external content on our platform. In this case, the services’ terms of service and privacy policy do apply.

In case Do-Not-Track (<abbr>DNT</abbr>) is enabled while attempting to view external content, we show a privacy warning that users can explicitly agree to. With DNT enabled, external services default to being inaccessible.

## Financial Transactions

For any financial transaction we use [Stripe](https://stripe.com). For payments and related data to be processed and get verified, the terms and conditions of the payment provider apply. Credit card numbers are never shared nor stored with us.

## Security

Even though we would like to, we can’t promise you absolute security until the end of times. What we can guarantee, is that we keep your personal information as safe as possible and are doing our best to protect all data stored on Colloq. In case we will become aware of any sort of data breach, we will inform all affected users promptly.
